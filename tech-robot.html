            <h2>Robots</h2>
            <p>
                Robots are a particularly interesting area of technology that has developed rapidly in recent years. Specifically in the area of agriculture, different types of robotics solutions are used in various ways to improve efficiency and productivity in agricultural processes (Bogue, 2021).  
            </p>
            
            <h3>About Robots in Agriculture</h3>
            <p>
                Du et. al. (2022) describes remote sensing technologies in drones that are currently being utilised during the growing process.
                In this part the farming process applications include the monitoring the health of crops, monitoring for infestation and identifying areas of crops that require irrigation.
                The tool has the benefits of time saving and high levels of precision; a drone can carry out these tasks much faster than any human could and can pinpoint issues requiring attention with more accuracy than even the trained human eye.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, considering that water is a scarce resource in many farming environments, the ability to water only where it is needed is great opportunity to optimise the allocation of scarce resources.
                Drone technology can also be used also to identify irrigation leaks (Columbus, 2021) further optimising on a finite resource.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Remote sensing is also utilised for crop yield predictions; Remote sensor technologies consider crop health and rate of growth, and are used alongside 3D mapping carried out by drones (Columbus, 2021) to predict the impact of poor weather and disease on the ultimate yield of a crop (Du et. al. 2022).
                This gives farmers the ability to plan for harvesting with  a high level of accuracy, (Bogue, 2021) ensuring the right amount of labour is hired at the right time. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Utilisation of drones for crop spraying is another recent development.
                This robotic solution also allows crop spraying to be carried out much faster and with a high level of precision in comparison to a human operator.
                This is considered a “labour saving technology” (Du et. al. 2022) so, while there are still human tasks to carry out as a part of the process, the manual labour is minimised, by the work done by the drone.
                Here through the high level of accuracy reduction in the damage to crops through mistaken spraying is observed, and weeds and infestation are quickly and effectively eliminated; a drone can apply herbicide to an individual weed. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Future developments in the area of Robots in agriculture are fascinating and innovative.
                In the coming years, Mobile Field Robots (which are currently in prototyping) will have the functionality to perform many traditionally human functions in the industry, for example preparing soil, seeding as well as the application of herbicides, pesticides and fertilisers (Bogue, 2021).
                It is in this space of herbicide/pesticide application that great innovation exists, as these robots have the potential greatly reduce the use of chemicals due to their high rate of precision.
                They also have the potential to apply alternative methods outside of chemicals, such as uprooting and heat treatment to eliminate weeds (Bogue, 2021).
                These robots will be made possible by the development of mobile platforms that are capable of operating in outdoor environments,  in dynamic and undefined conditions (Bogue, 2021) 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another potential that is emerging in the field of robotics in agriculture is Artificial Intelligence (AI) in robots.
                AI is being developed to assess food quality prior to harvest, through the use of large datasets of images of the relevant food sort (Du et. al. 2022) alongside captured images of the growing crops.
                Columbus (2021) described the future of agriculture as one where “AI, machine learning, in-ground sensors, infrared imagery and real-time video analytics all combine to provide farmers with new insights into how they can improve crop health and yields”.  
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Impacts of Robots in Agriculture</h3>
            <p>
                As with any new and innovative technological advancement, there are many impacts to be considered in this space.
                Some positive impacts, some negative impacts, and some that are certainly cause for debate. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As determined by Bogue, (2021) and discussed in the previous section, these technologies aim to improve the efficiency and productivity of agricultural practices, and they are successful achieving that purpose.
                When we look at the possibility of minimising or eliminating the use of herbicides in agriculture, the positive impact on planet, people and land owners is undeniable.
                The negative impact of herbicides is well documented, effecting the environment, farmland (by killing beneficial insects that live in the soil) and humans (causing cancer and birth defects) (Bogue, 2021).
                Certainly, then, any technology that results in fewer herbicides being used is a great positive impact. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When we consider the future of robots in agriculture, farmers, to have an accurate insight into the quality of their crops and their upcoming yield will ensure they secure the best possible prices for their goods (Columbus, 2021).
                The implementation of AI will reap benefits from upper to lower food supply chain: when a farmer has accurate forecasts of ‘to be yielded’ quantities and visibility over a negative impact to the quality of a harvest, supply can be managed more effectively.
                Results are less likelihood of shortage or overstock situations; and issues can be identified quickly to avoid bottlenecks in the supply chain which could result in wastage of fresh goods (Du et. al, 2022). 
            </p>
            <p>
                A negative impact to the implementation of robots in agriculture is the certain loss of labour jobs in the industry (Bogue, 2021).
                Fewer workers are required in farm settings to carry out the labour-intensive work that is now replaced by robotics solutions, with this likely to increase further.
                Interestingly, Columbus (2021) argues that due to the labour shortages in the industry, replacing the human role with a robot gives the farmer more certainty that a time sensitive task can be completed.  
            </p>
            
            <h3>How This Affects Us Directly</h3>
            <p>
                As with the impacts on the greater community, as a group we will be impacted both positively and negatively by innovations in robotics and agriculture. Some of these impacts are dependent on our differing personal circumstances, other are dependent very much on our differing perceptions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Each person in our group, and out families and loved ones are positively impacted when there is improved food availability at a decreased cost to consumers. We are similarly, all to benefit form improved food quality and safety of fresh foods (Du et. al. 2022). 
            </p>
            <p>
                More than one member of our group is living in or grew up in farming communities in Australia. They will see and know people that are directly impacted by this technology.
                People who have limited skills and limited access to other jobs in their rural communities, who will no longer have a reliable income due to these technological advancements.
                Certainly, when the people we know and love are directly impacted like this, it is more difficult to accept the positive impacts of this change. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There is an argument to counter this perspective, however.
                Salimova, et. al. (2021) looked at the expected wages that farm labourers often lost when a crop was negatively impacted by weather or infestation, or when yield was much lower than expected.
                While fewer jobs may exist in the industry, when farmers have a good oversight of these issues and predictions, it allows for a more reliable view of the seasonal work these labourers can expect. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, it is interesting that (especially in farming communities) these changes are seen overwhelmingly as negative due to the loss of jobs it brings with it.
                The technologies are bringing with them great benefit for profitability, food supply and sustainability (Recuro-Virto and Valilla-Arrospide (2021).
                It will take time and education to shift that perspective in the greater community.
