            <h2>Group Reflections</h2>
            <h3>Sunggil</h3>
            <p>
                I thought that our team working and communication went well as everyone had contributed and responded to the meetings as planned.
                The work that was assigned to each of us was completed on time and without stress.
                I think that maybe our meeting schedules could have been improved however this was expected as it was impossible to figure out exact time and days everyone was free (if there even were any matching time slots that everyone was free) in their busy personal schedules.
                One thing that surprised me was how everyone made an effort to make our project complete as I have had plenty of experiences before where there would always be that one person that would not do any work.
                One thing that I learned about our group is that this is what mature, adult group projects are meant to be where everyone did/does jobs they are assigned.
                To be brutally honest, Charlie has done all the work converting our work into our website as he was most familiar using html and css coding.
                Although he could have used some help I believe it would have been a drag down for Charlie to teach the rest of the group how to complete the vision he had in mind about our website.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Mihail</h3>
            <p>
                What went well:<br/>
                Overall, I think the participation level within the group was an above satisfactory, where in most of the time, everyone was able to have an input into ideas and objectives, decisions were made unanimously, and we were able to achieve a majority of the objectives before the deadline.<br/>
                What could be improved:<br/>
                The group operated successfully and there was not much need for improvement.
                The only issues were late submissions of work, this delaying other parts of the project.<br/>
                Surprising Fact:<br/>
                The one fact that I found surprising, was lack of effort needed to work together.
                The group seemed to feel at ease with each other quite quickly, and an absence of conflict.
                Nobody tried to override decisions or cause issues within the group.<br/>
                Group Learning:<br/>
                Even though we were all strangers before starting the group, it was not difficult to start collaborating on ideas and opinions, and that working within a team, more can be achieved quicker, than just a singular person.<br/>
                Tools Activity:<br/>
                The GitHub workflow reflects that only one or two people within the group actively participated. This was due to assigning certain members to work on that part of the project.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Peter</h3>
            <p>
                The one thing that went really in our group was the use of teams and the integration of OneNote to it to keep all our work together in one place and make it more efficient to create amendments.
                In addition to that the table of actions to be completed which I believe Katherine was responsible for putting together, was a grate in highlighting the key actions that need to be taken for our next meeting and who is responsible for them.
                One thing that I believe could be improved would be the visualisation of the scope of the project as a whole to allow for better priority management and us to always be able to keep track of where we are.
                I believe a tool like 'Jira' or 'Trello' would be ideal for our next group project.
                One thing that I found surprising was the commitment of the group in being able to complete tasks on time and being so active in scheduling meetings, in addition to that the consistency of the meeting times was also quite intriguing.
                One thing I learned about groups was that everyone has a different way of thinking about tasks and it allows for a quick change in perspective.
                I don't think that the GitHub log activity fully reflects the group's work, as the website was built mainly by Charlie consequently he will have more commits.
            </p>

            <h3>Kate</h3>
            <p>
                <p>
                    Our group used Microsoft teams as a platform for communication and collaboration fairly effectively.
                    We created a OneNote Notebook within the Teams Channel and used this to collaborate on our work, to share resources and for meeting Agendas and actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Communication overall in our group could be improved.
                    When members are missing from calls without prior communication it makes it difficult in our calls to assign work and to ensure previously assigned work has been completed.
                    I feel like we could have completed the assignment sooner and more easily if our communication was more consistent as a group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One surprising thing for me was the different ways of working we observe within this particular group.
                    We have group members that communicated a lot and some that communicated not so much, we have group members who work to timeframes well and others who followed their own timeframes but ultimately the work got done.
                    This was challenging for me, but I learned that alternate ways of working are not wrong ways of working, and I should not expect others to work the same way I do, as long as we reach our common goal.
                </p>
            </p>

            <h3>Charlie</h3>
            <p>
                <p>
                    Working in a group increased our efficiency and produced a better product.
                    Our personalities conflicted perfectly in a constructive manner, bringing together the worlds of imagination, realism, and focus to our project. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we worked in our group it was common for people to attempt to make the workload even amongst all people.
                    However, there are times when this would not work since if someone delayed their workload due to external commitments, the entire project would end up delayed.
                    This problem may have been averted if we properly formatted our workload and time, utilising tools such as a Gantt chart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When working in groups, I have learned that it is important that somebody takes charge and assigns work as necessary.
                    We are all acting on the same level, and it is creating times of confusion or moments where people are waiting on someone else to decide what to do next.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, as our group did not assign work through GitHub and the final GitHub activity seems as if one member did the work, it was collectively done on another medium (Microsoft Teams), which ended up being more community focussed and efficient for the method we undertook. 
                </p>
            </p>

            <h3>Samith</h3>
            <p>
                <p>
                    Regarding what went well during our group reflection, our communication was effective, and everyone could contribute their ideas and thoughts on the assignment via our group chat and virtual meetings.
                    Additionally, we divided tasks and worked efficiently to complete most of the work on time.
                    We provided constructive feedback to each other throughout the project, which helped improve the final product's overall quality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have done a better way of establishing clear roles and responsibilities throughout this project.
                    So, we only have a little to improve. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    One surprising thing was the level of engagement from all group members.
                    Despite being in different physical locations and time zones, we could effectively collaborate and complete the assignment.
                    I was impressed by the level of participation and the quality of the work that everyone produced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through this group project, I have learned the importance of clear communication, effective task management and setting roles and responsibilities in a group.
                    Also, establishing trust and respect among group members is vital to foster a positive and productive working environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The GitHub activity log doesn't accurately reflect everyone's work on this assignment because most experienced members in CSS and HTML took responsibility for delivering a quality product at the end of creating the website.
                </p>
            </p>
            <h3>Group reflection</h3>
            <p>
                <p>
                    <h4>What went well?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The meeting schedule was consistent, despite everyone's busy schedule and working from differing time zones.
                        Overall, the group reflects that members were consistent with the attendance, or had valid reasons when they could not attend the meetings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We allocated different tasks to different people based on their skills, previous contributions and current workload and over the timeframe of the assignment this worked out well with all group member contributing equally to the final result.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What could be improved?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The tracking of assignment components could have been improved by utilising a project software solution such as Trello or Jira.
                        The group reflected on a lack of leadership in the sense that we waited till someone volunteered to do a specific task rather than assigning tasks.
                        Assignment of tasks could have been more time effective in achieving our end result.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Application familiarity  would have benefited the group in this project; because few members were familiar with Microsoft Team prior to this assignment, we could have utilised the scheduling function more effectively by scheduling meetings ahead of time; small things can make a big impact with group work.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Something that was surprising</h4>
                    <p>
                        The most surprising thing about this group was the ability of the group to collaborate effectively; despite the fact that the group were strangers, at differing stages of their studies and living in multiple parts of the world- one group member is even living in Germany- but we have managed to work together!  This, we agree is quite an achievement.
                        As a group, despite the challenges, we are happy with the quality of work we have been able to produce.
                    </p>
                    <h4>One thing we learned about working in groups</h4>
                    <p>
                        The personality contrast between our group members is drastic, yet we were able to produce a project we are all happy with.
                        Amongst our group we observed quiet people and dominant personalities.
                        We also had members with differing IT skills and all level of knowledge.
                        Our interest may vary and the reason we are getting into the IT industry are quite different throughout the whole team, yet, we are all able to cooperate and produce a quality product.
                        In this sense we learned the differing strengths of different group members can end up complimenting one another to contribute to a great end result.
