                    After examining Charlie’s profile and test scores, I think that he would be a valuable asset to any team.
                    His work ethic and pursuit for continual improvement, and attention to the details, will ensure the success of any project that he is involved in.
                    His willingness and ability to step up and take the lead, will take any wayward team and would help the team stay focused and in the right direction.
                    With the assertiveness, as described in the personality profile, Charlie would most likely not hold his tongue and air the issue with mind to resolve and dispute any discrepancies that may affect the team workflow.<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To my understanding, a visual learner, which is most prominent in the learning styles quiz results, show that Charlie would do better to have materials in a visual format, meaning they need to see the materials in front of them, whether it be images, diagrams, or text, and can also include excellent spatial awareness and photographic memory.
                    The strengths this style of learning brings to the team are, well-managed organisation, visualisation of tasks, follows directions (Visual Learning Style Traits and Strategies (thoughtco.com)

                    Kate's profile gives us an idea of her personality and learning styles and some insight into her potential strengths and weaknesses in a group setting.
                    According to her results on a learning styles test, Kate has a strong preference for auditory (67%) and visual (59%) learning and a weaker preference for kinaesthetic learning (44%).
                    This result suggests that she has a good memory for spoken information, strong public speaking skills, and can effectively explain ideas.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The results of the Myers-Briggs personality test shows that Kate is introverted (52%), observant (71%), thinking (71%), judging (93%), and assertive (74%).
                    These traits suggest that Kate is honest and direct, dutiful, and responsible, calm, and practical.
                    Overall, Kate would be an asset to any team.

                <p>
                    Mihail lives in Brisbane, Queensland and has for the last seven years.
                    Mihail's aim is to obtain a degree in information technology or in computer science.
                    Mihail has previously completed certificates in IT. Mihail has interests in 3D Modelling, gaming, playing guitar, and golf.
                    Mihail's multi-cultured upbringing of Kiwi/Russian will likely introduce more varied opinions and thoughts into our group, which will be eager to invest our interest within.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mihail's personality is defined by the Myer Brigg's 16 personality of a turbulent logistician, ISTJ-T. This personality's primary trait is to be a meticulous hard worker.
                    This is prominent throughout our works, as Mihail is ready to volunteer to do work and the produced work from him is always work a dedicated read, as it often has insights we would not ordinarily see ourselves.
                    This is evident as Mihail's energy is through observance, and his personality is strongly down to earth, and he maintains a strong realistic view of the world, and what is realistically feasible for everyone to do as a group.
                <p>
                    Mihail is a visual learner, which is optimised in fast paced meetings with solo learning/contribution efforts.
                    We will require to adapt our meetings and confidently assign work as required to be done in an organised and fluid fashion, which does not deficit the remainder of our group members.

                    Peter is an INTJ-T which indicates he is rational, informed, independent, determined, curious and original.
                    However, it also indicates that he can be arrogant, dismissive of emotions, overly critical, combative and socially clueless.
                    To best help our group in our work with Peter, we should allow Peter to help make and finalise decisions.
                    His rationality, determination and being informed, he would have a respectable place in making important decisions for the group.
                    His independency would prove useful to complete any tasks that needs to be completed. His curiosity and originality would be useful for brainstorming ideas for the group.
                    His weaknesses in my opinion are just a by-product of how useful he can be towards the group and would not necessarily affect the group in a bad way.
                    I personally could overlook his arrogancy, emotional dismissiveness, socially cluelessness if it meant that he would provide good ideas to the group, make good decisions, and get his parts done.
                    If any group members do have issues, we could just have a conversation about what is affecting certain members and compromise.

                    Samiths personal profile is providing us with enough information to make some assumptions about his team dynamic in the group.
                    Based on his results from the Myers-Briggs test his role seems to be one of the diplomates in the group he focuses on empathy and master’s diplomacy.
                    In addition to that, he seems to be a people master, he seems at ease at social gatherings such as meetings and he is comfortable expressing his own thoughts and opinions with the group.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adding onto that based on his personality-max report, one of his learning styles seems to be auditory (33%) based on that we can assume that he would be comfortable learning by actively listening to the information in the meetings.
                    In addition to that he is visual (35%) so some sort of imagery or graph in the meetings could help him and assist his learning and ability to effectively gather and retain information.
                    Finally, he is also a kinaesthetic (32%) learner so having some examples as we talk in the meetings could further assist him.

                    Sunggil's personal profile gives us an insight into his personality and learning styles, and some suggestion to what may be his strengths and weaknesses when working in a group. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    His results from the learning styles test showed he is Auditory 40%, visual 35%, Tactile 25%.
                    This is a fairly balanced result, with a tendency towards auditory learning. This indicates Sunggil will be adaptive to learning in different ways and has the capacity to learn from others in a group setting. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The results of the Big 5 test returned a very high result for openness; suggesting he is imaginative and down to earth, which could complement some other logical thinkers in our team.
                    His extraversion also suggests he will be an active participant and could bring the group together during difficult times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A result of 23% for conscientiousness suggests other group members may need to hold him accountable in to complete the task at hand in this project.
