            <h2>BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY AND CRYPTOCURRENCIES</h2>
            <i>Written by Mihail</i>
                <h3>Blockchain Technology</h3>
                <p>A blockchain is a decentralised, distributed ledger that holds the records of transactions, then corroborated and retained by a peer-to-peer network of computers.
                    No central authority governs the blockchain, such as governments or any centralized organization, but a collective of global individuals.
                    Once a record has been added to the blockchain, no one individual can modify or erase records or any previously recorded.
                    Each record contains the public key for the sender, a public key for the receiver (with the possibility of multiple receiver keys), and the information of the transaction.
                    Every recorded transaction is cryptographically linked to previous recorded transactions and a copy of the transaction is stored on every computer within the network.
                    This helps prevent unauthorized access and modifications to each record as the append would have to occur on each computer to be valid. (Yli-Huumo J, 2016) (Sarmah, 2018). 
                </p>

                    Blockchain technology first appeared with launch of a new digital currency, Bitcoin, in 2008, theories on blockchains and papers outlining the fundamental concepts and initial prototypes of blockchain technologies were created since the late 1980’s and early 1990’s  (Dylan Yaga, 2019).
                    But when a developer going by the pseudonym, Satori Nakamoto released his paper; “Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System in 2008, it was only then that blockchain technology’s’ inception became official.
                    Within a few months of it release, and usage of a combination of previously outlined technologies, an open-source implementation for bitcoin was created and the initial bitcoins were released in 2009 (Sarmah, 2018).

                <p>
                    Besides the use of blockchains within the realms of crypto-currency, additional industries have researching adopted the technology within their given field.
                    Healthcare, for example, the potential for increased patient management, used to maintain supply-chain management, as well as have more stringent control measures for data access.
                    Through the use blockchain technology, security and access control could be more enhanced, giving more control to the patient, as well as providing a more secure method to share records between providers. ( (Hölbl, 2018).  
                </p>
                <h4>
                    The impact Blockchain will have. 
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Blockchain technology has great potential for use the business and private sector for record management, assets and digitization of goods and services, without the need for third-party authentication and control.
                    Blockchain can be merged to use with other technologies such as artificial intelligence, vehicle automation and cloud computing to mention a few.
                    A key example of how blockchain can be used to increase efficiency within a business, is immutable record-keeping.
                    As each file is created as a single entity and validated by a consensus, this provides only one version of the document, thus lowering the need for audits and keeping dispute resolutions to a minimum.
                    Also, blockchain provides proof-of-existence, validating only one copy, and can prevent prohibited duplication and the ability to counterfeit (Aste, Tasca, & Di Matteo, 2017).
                    Blockchain provides greater transparency as it allows a view of the digital form start to end and provides an auditable trail of all transactions added to the ledger. (Could Blockchain Have as Great as impact as the Internet)

                <h4>
                    How will this technology affect me: 
                </h4>
                <p>
                    As a potential software developer, I am sure I will encounter this technology either during the study of Information Technology or integrating the technology into software that I may develop in the future.
                    This, of course will increase the learning I will have to undertake, along with other technologies that may appear during the course of my study and/or employment.
                    Through the course of daily life, I may or may not know if the current technology would have incorporated into the applications that I use.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    This cause no difference in the way that I would go about my life.
                    Being a backend technology, no visibility would occur unless I was working with technology first-hand.
                    As far as affecting friends and family, I do not believe they would know if the technology was present in the applications they were using, without further delving into fine print of the applications.
                    Neither groups would have any first-hand experience in dealing with technology and may not in near or far future.

                <h3>Cryptocurrency</h3>
                <p>
                    The definition of cryptocurrency is a digital payment method for the exchanges of goods and services via a computer network that does not rely on a central authority to maintain and control it (Milutinović, 2018).
                    The aim of cryptocurrency is to a have decentralised system where parties can verify that each of the parties has the funds available, removing the need for an intermediary. (Yaffe-Bellany, 2022).
                    Information of ownership is stored in a digital ledger, which also records all transactions, controls the flow of supplementary coins and ensures verification of all transactions.
                    All information stored is secured cryptographically in a database called a blockchain.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The original cryptocurrency that was first introduced was Bitcoin, released in 2008, by the developer, Satoshi Nakamoto.
                    (Dylan Yaga, 2019), but since then, a multitude of other various cryptocurrencies have emerged into the market, known as altcoins.
                    These include Litecoin, 2011, and Ripple in 2012.
                    Litecoin offers advantages over Bitcoin in the way its mined or verified, by offering a memory-intensive algorithm know as a Scrypt POW algorithm.
                    This allowed more users to participate in verification without the need of specialized hardware, as required by Bitcoin.
                    Litecoin offers the advantages of a quicker processing time, and able to process a higher volume of transactions at any one time.
                    Another technology introduced with the advent of Ethereum, were smart contracts.
                    These allow the control of events and actions within the guidelines of the contract/agreement (Röscheisen, 1998).
                    The outlying purpose for smart contracts, was to reduce the need for trusted third parties, costs and prevent the possibility of fraudulent attacks. (Fries, 2019)

                    With investments into blockchain technology, such as the introduction of BAAS; Blockchain as a service, which will rely on cloud-based technologies.
                    Tech-giants such as Microsoft and Amazon have invested heavily into this technology.
                    Typical usage for this type of product could be decentralized apps and smart contracts.
                    Other uses in include DeFi (Decentralized Finance applications), and Payment Settlement Systems.
                    This investment could see the rise in value for cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Bitcoin (CryptoGT, 2021).

                <h4>
                    The impact Cryptocurrency will have: 
                </h4>
                <p>
                    With emergence of cryptocurrencies and the advancement of surrounding technologies, cryptocurrencies are promoting growth and development with the fintech industry, namely supply chains and value chains.
                    As a growth proponent for the fintech industry, cryptocurrency promotes the independence from intermediaries and reduces centralised control while contributing to the development of a digital economy (Innov, 2021). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While there are benefits in utilising cryptocurrency, many believe that cryptocurrency has had an environmental impact with increased energy consumption associated with “mining” of cryptocurrency.
                    Environmentalists believe that this may result in an increase to carbon emissions and effectively speed the process of climate change. (Research, 2021)

                </h4>
                <p>
                    The effect, if any, that this technology will have on myself or others around me, will ultimately come down to whether this technology will become a mainstream payment system.
                    Currently, I have no investments in cryptocurrency nor any future interest in this technology at this current time.
                    However, during my studies or hopeful employment in the future, I may encounter this technology and further learning and possible investment may occur.
