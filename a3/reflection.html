                We successfully implemented a project management tool within Microsoft Teams, which helped us stay organised and on track. Katherine volunteered to be the project leader, and her utilisation of the scheduling function helped to assign tasks appropriately and ensure that we met our deadlines. This was surprising, given the size of the project and the fact that we had some communication issues. Our communication could have been more effective, especially when it came to updating each other on the status of individual tasks. We also noticed that some members were overburdened with work, and the workload distribution could have been more balanced to prevent this. Despite our challenges during the assignment, we completed it on time and to a high standard. We have learned that effective leadership and clear communication are essential for the success of group projects. By having a project leader and utilising a project management tool, we were able to stay organised and focused throughout the project. However, we also recognised the importance of open communication and regular check-ins with each other to ensure that everyone is on the same page. Due to the fact that the more experienced team members assumed the responsibility for developing the prototype website, the GitHub activity log may only partially represent the contributions of some team members.

                In Assignment 3 the group utilised a Project Planning Board in Microsoft Teams to keep a track of our tasks, responsibility of team members and progress of the project overall. I thought this was very effective and a great improvement from Assignment 2, as each member could look at the board at any time and see what tasks they had to do, when it was due, and gauge the workload across the group. 
            </p><p>
                Communication between team members remained an area that could be improved, with a few team members generally not responding to posts in the Teams Channel, and not communicating when they cannot make the group calls. With improved communication we could have been so much more productive and achieved much more within our timeframe. One thing that was surprising to me is how the group has adapted to working together; it was much easier to work collaboratively as a team in assignment 3, and I feel that is a reflection of the group getting used to each other’s different ways of working, and playing to the strengths of each team member. This has taught me that a successful group need not all have the same outlook, the same ways of working or even the same opinions, but they need to be able to collaborate regardless of those differences.

                With this assignment, we had evolved our groups processes, allowing for more efficient task management and better handling of communication issues. In my personal opinion, I believe that the group had collaborated in a more effective manner. There were still teething issues, mainly with communication. Unfortunately, not everyone was able to attend all meetings and this had led to missed information regarding task allocations and progress tracking. The use of the Planner functionality within Microsoft Teams had eased this burden by allowing updates to the progress of the project, however tasks had not been always updated in a timely fashion.  
            </p><p>
                Overall the group had worked well together, achieving what was needed to produce the scoped project and the documentation required, all within the time constraints given. The experience gained with working within the team has proven useful and will provide valuable insight into the future ahead.

                We utilised management tools within Microsoft teams during assignment 3. Our group's usage of these tools has been highly effective since we are easily able to track what work remains incomplete and what work needs to be prioritised over others during a quick glance throughout a meeting. This is a significant improvement over assignment 2; as it was our primary complaint which every member held the opinion of. I have realised the importance of encouragement and presence in a team, our team became overburdened with tasks due to the shorter timeframe allocated to this assignment than what was originally anticipated, therefore the team's morale decreased throughout the weeks since work seemed to always become larger. For future reference, I find it will be important to track each member's morale and motivation going forward, and take necessary action as required. However, as this is not an industry-equivalent experience, I will be taking it with myself into the work force.

                This time around the use of the teams’ planner was a great addition to our arsenal of tools. It allowed us to better understand and visualize the number of tasks that we had to complete and eliminated the back-and-forth of trying to see where we were currently. One thing that could have been improved this time around would have been the more effective use of our resources and time. If we had a sprint planning at the beginning of the assignment and developed a proper backlog/in progress and completed folders. We would have been able to more easily identify bottlenecks and allow for a swarm approach to take place and tackle the task. Also during the sprint planning we could have allocated from the beginning based on name alphabetical order who would be the scrum master for the particular stand-up. That would have allowed for a better flow during meetings as the responsibility and leadership falls to the scrum-master. One surprising thing that I found was that we were able to still produce the same level and quality of work and even more in half the amount of time as we all were able to come together and focus to the aim.

                I think that the usage of Microsoft Teams went really well and Kate is to thank for that. She figured out a way to use a checklist task manager that helped the group to digest and allocate parts of the assignment to be done by others very easily and efficiently. I also believe everyone did a good amount of work spread out between the group members and no one seemed to have a problem with anyone not doing their work.  
            </p><p>
                However, it comes to say that our group working and communication can still be improved upon. Personally as it was the last few weeks of the term with other commitments it was difficult to come around every meeting and to keep up to date with the checklist and the urgent tasks that needed to be done. I still believe we made it in the end, thanks to a few people that really kept on top of our work and pushed others to complete assigned work and really kept updating others on the posting section.  
            </p><p>
                One thing that surprised me was how we still managed to produce a good amount of work even without the perfect group meetings and without that much time with a lot of other commitments at hand. I definitely learned that group working is a skill that must be worked on, it may come naturally to others but there is still a lot to be learned and improved upon which is valuable experience I have gained whilst working with my fellow group members.

            <h2>Group Reflection</h2>
            <h3>What Went Well?</h3>
            <p>
                In assignment 2 the group reflected that keeping a track of project tasks, areas of responsibility and project timelines was challenging and messy. So, for assignment 3 we implemented a project planned in Teams, and Katherine took on a role of part time project manager. This worked very well, as each team member could access the board to get an overview of tasks at any time, some responsibility is on group member to keep the board updated, and Katherine oversaw task completion as a whole and pushed timeframes to remain on target. 
            </p>
            <h3>What Could be Improved?</h3>
            <p>
                Group communication is the key point that the group has identified could be improved to ultimately produce a higher quality of work in the final submission. The group recognizes that some aspects of communication have improved since Assignment 2; meeting scheduling, meeting agendas and actions were consistently done during Assignment 3. However, the group struggled to communicate effectively via teams in between calls and some members did not regularly update the project board with their progress, meaning the rest of the group had no visibility on what work was getting done. 
            </p>
            <h3>Something that was Surprising?</h3>
            <p>
                Despite the challenges, the group as a whole reflects that the group process overall was easier in Assignment 3. This is surprising because the timeline was tight and there were challenges, but overall there was less stress in the group in meeting the deadline. We reflect that this is because the group has built some working relationship and come to understand one another’s working style. Also, a level of trust has been built, so group members have some confidence that their team mates will get the work done. 
            </p>
            <h3>One thing we learned about working in groups</h3>
            <p>
                Our group was made up of individuals with drastically different personalities, interests, and levels of IT skills. Some members were quiet and reserved, while others were more dominant and vocal. It seemed impossible to find common ground at first, but as we worked together, we learned to appreciate the unique strengths of each team member. We learned that even the most contrasting personalities could come together and complement each other to produce a high-quality end result. The key to our success was effective leadership and clear communication. Our project leader, Katherine, was crucial in keeping us organised and on track. We may have started as strangers with different goals and motivations, but by the end of the project, we had become a cohesive team that was proud of what we had accomplished.
