            <h2>Personal Information</h2>
            <p>
                Sudo A+ is a group of six individuals studying Essentials of Information Technology (COSC2196) as an elective subject.
                The team members are Charlie Morrison, Katherine Sullivan, Panagiotis Papanastasatos, Samith Buthgama, Mihail Basargin and Sunggil Kang. 
            </p>
            <h2>Group Processes</h2>
            <p>
                In Assignment 2, the group maintained a consistent meeting schedule despite the challenges posed by differing time zones and personal schedules.
                Members generally attended meetings regularly or had valid reasons for absences.
                The tasks for the assignment were divided among group members based on their skills, previous contributions, and workload.
                Dividing work in an efficient manner allowed for all members to contribute an equal amount to the final result.
                Therefore, our group managed time effectively throughout the period we worked on Assignment 2. We believe we can finish with a quality product in assignment 3. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In Assignment 3, our group has implemented multiple changes in order to improve our efficiency further.
                Knowing that this project will have to be larger than the previous one we had worked on together, we have implemented a project management tool contained within Microsoft Teams.
                After the group reflected on a lack of leadership and direction in Assignment 2, Katherine volunteered to take on a leadership role and therefore was the member who assigned tasks appropriately.
                By utilizing the scheduling function in MS Teams, Katherine created a timeline for tasks to ensure that the group finished the assignment on time.
                By utilizing the scheduling function and having members familiar with relevant technology, the group believe assignment 3 can finish more effectively and efficiently towards the end goal.
            </p>
            <h2>Career Plans</h2>
            <p>We have an eclectic group with varied career plans, all of them ambitious!</p>
            <p>
                Some common elements exist, in that four of our group members have career plans in the field of software development, in different capacities.
                While Samith has a clear plan; his ideal role is a full-stack developer, Mihail and Sunggil are leaving options open to their ‘ideal role’ depending on where their studies and the industry take them.
                Peter is currently working in the Industry, so he plans to progress that career by moving into a role of a Senior Front End Developer but is also open to the idea of management roles and analyst roles. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another similarity in the group is our studies.
                The whole group are using their studies to broaden their skills in their chosen areas, and most group members plan to see where those skills will taken them; software development is the direction Sunggil, Samith, Mihail and Peter are headed, while Charlie's focus is Cyber Security and Kate – the outlier of the group, in a business related field - is aiming for a career as a business consultant in IT projects. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In Assignment Two the group identified their ideal jobs;  
                <ol>
                    <li>Front End Software Developer</li>
                    <li>Graduate Software Developer</li>
                    <li>Software Developer</li>
                    <li>Full-Stack Developer</li>
                    <li>Software Engineer</li>
                    <li>Supply Chain Business Manager</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                But there is some change in the group now.
                Charlie has adapted his ambition from Software engineer to the Cyber Security Industry, due to an opportunity form his current employer to progress in this field.
                While other group members say their ideal jobs remain the same, most of the group see the need to be flexible in their Ivison of their future career, depending on changes that may happen in the industry and opportunities that may come up.
            </p>
            <p>
                Samith is focused on a long term career plan as a full -stack developer, and Mihail is also interested in purseing a career in software development, but he is not clear yet whether that will be in general software, frontend, backend or full stack development.
                Sunggil has similar aspirations in the short term, and all three of these group members have a common short term plan; to build as many technical skills as possible through the course of their chosen degrees.
                These group members also feel that their learning so far and feedback from assignments one and two have cemented their vision of their ideal job in the short to medium term.
            </p>
            <p>
                Peter is already working in his chosen IT field and has short to medium term goals of progressing that career by moving into a role of a Senior Front End Developer, potentially even a Manager or Analyst.
                His goal is to pursue those goals alongside completing his studies, which is an approach shared by Charlie and Kate also.
                In the long term, Charlie, Kate and Sunggil have career plans that will build upon their current learning and current (or future) job roles in different ways; Sunggil hopes to set up his own start up, Charlie hopes to pursue a career in cyber security; potentially leading an SOC team, and Kate is aiming to be a business process consultant when her current project role ends.  
            </p>
            <p>
                It is clear that there are some big differences within the group.
                Even the group members pursuing software developer roles could end up in very different parts of the industry.
                But one great commonality for each member is the possibilities that completion of their studies will open up for the future.
