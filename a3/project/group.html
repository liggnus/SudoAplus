            <h2>Group Processes and Communication</h2>
            <p>
                Our group has aligned on the following processes around group communication
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Communication will be via Teams; the group set up a new channel for Assignment 3. Group members will post any communication for the group in that channel and tag any/all relevant people. </li>
                <li>The group will meet Wednesday and Friday evening each week via a video call in Teams. During the calls members should have their cameras on (where possible) </li>
                <li>All meetings will be recorded by the team members leading the call</li>
                <li>If a group member cannot make the scheduled call the expectation is that they let the group know, watch the recording and take any actions assigned to them in the call </li>
                <li>It may be necessary to have additional calls when the workload is high. These calls will be scheduled ad hoc on a day and time that suits the group </li>
                <li>If a group member does not respond to communication, we agreed to give them 3 days grace. During those three days the group will try to make contact via Discord. After 3  days with no communication the following steps will be taken:
                    <ul>
                        <li>One team member will reach out to a course tutor via canvas inbox and include the inactive member in that message. The aim is to express concern that the group member is not going participate any further </li>
                        <li>On the fifth day the group will assume the inactive member is not coming back to the group and work will be redistributed</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The project board in the Teams channel acts as a way to track progress on project tasks. Each member is responsible for keeping their tickets up to date. This is another form of communication between the group as to what stage each group member is up to with their work </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The technical aspects required to implement the above processes is an understanding and a beginner to intermediate knowledge of Microsoft Teams, and a basic understanding of how discussion boards are used within the Canvas framework, as outlined in the Canvas guide . To efficiently utilise Microsoft Teams and to better the processes outlined above, knowledge and experience of the functionalities included with the software application is a must. Poor knowledge may lead to missing components and a lack of understanding of the tasks required and assignments of those tasks within the group.</p>
            <p>The specific functions within the Microsoft Teams framework that the group utilises are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Video Conferencing: The feature is used to schedule the twice-weekly meetings. A beginner knowledge base would suffice to appropriately make use of this feature. However, a brief overview of how this functionality is applied is required, as its main features are not immediately apparent. Having knowledge and experience of the features available, allow for a timely setup </li>
                <li>Planner Application: The use of this feature does require an intermediate knowledge to make the most of its functionality. While beginner knowledge may allow for the setup of a project plan, knowing the technical capabilities of the application allows for a project plan that is more clearly defined, allows for easier readability of the outcomes desired, and allows for the appropriate assigning of tasks that are clearly defined.</li>
            </ul>
