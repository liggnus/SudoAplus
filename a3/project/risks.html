            <h3>Scope of Work</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="/SudoAplus/images/3.png" width="400px">
                A possible risk that may develop during production, is a poorly specified scope of work, whether it may be underdefined, or missing important details, or not easily to comprehend. Any of these will cause a setback in production. Scope creep may also occur, where extra features or unexpected changes are added without the ability to fit in within the allocated timeframe for the project. </p>
            <p>
                How this can be avoided is to only allow enough features to be implemented within the allotted timeframe, and work within the scope of the team abilities. 
            </p>
            <h3>Human Resources</h3>
            <p>
                The ability to learn any new software or techniques can slow down the progression of any project. As not everyone will have the ability or the timeframe to learn the necessary skills needed. The website may not be produced to the description within the scope of work. A lack of communication between group members may also slow down the project, leading to confusion and disappointment, or the reliance on certain or limited team members. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The importance of good communication between team members is paramount to ensure success. Each team member should input to the best of their ability and communicate and collaborate on project items. Request help, if necessary, do not hesitate, as this also could lead to project delays. 
            </p>
            <h3>Technical Ability</h3>
            <p>
                Within our project, there is a need to learn to program new software, namely react, which involves the learning of a new language, JavaScript. In addition to being able to program in a new language, application programming interfaces (API’s), must be incorporated. Whether any of the team has the knowledge or the technical ability is unknown, which may cause a production failure. Other issues may include buggy code, compatibility issues with other software technologies, both of which will cause the website to malfunction or not run at all. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As a team, we need to work with within our abilities and learning curves. Some team members may be more proficient at tasks than others. When assigning roles, technical abilities must be accounted for and to ensure that each person can contribute to the project equally. 
            </p>
            <h3>Time Management</h3>
            <p>
                The importance of good time management for any project, is vital to the success of any project. Each development stage should be allocated sufficient time to ensure each stage is completed and technically sound. The lack of adequate time for any stage for the development process, can cause the delay for future development stages, risking an unfinished project or a rushed or technically inadequate website.  
            </p>
            <p>
                An allowance of extra time for each stage may help with time issues, leaving a buffer, to extend or complete other items. One way to mitigate the issue, is to install a ‘resource allocation plan’, to ensure sufficient resources are allocated for each developmental stage.
