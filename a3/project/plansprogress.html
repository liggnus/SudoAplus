            <h2>Plans and Progress</h2>
            <h3>Overview and Aims of the Project - Mihail</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of the website is to provide farmers with useful information, resources, and tools to help them improve their crop yields, manage their farms efficiently, and connect with other farmers in their region.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The goals of the website are to: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide valuable information on agriculture practices and crop management </li>
                    <li>Stay up to date on market prices of common commodities in the Australian Market </li>
                    <li>Offer a marketplace for farmers to buy and sell their products </li>
                    <li>Learn and share valuable regional agricultural information in a regularly updated blog section </li>
                    <li>Increase awareness of sustainable farming practices </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The target audience for the website are farmers, both small and large-scale, who are interested in improving their farming practices and finding new opportunities to grow their businesses. Research should include their needs, preferences, and challenges. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We need to select a domain name that reflects the purpose of the website and is easy to remember for the target audience. The website should be easy to navigate, visually appealing, and optimized for different devices. We will consider the use of images, videos, and infographics to make the content engaging and accessible. We will also create high-quality content that is relevant and useful to the target audience. The content should be easy to read and understand, and include topics such as crop management, market trends, and sustainable farming practices.  An advanced feature not scoped within the current timeframe, is an online marketplace similar to marketplaces found on Facebook and Pinterest. This feature would allow farmers from around the country to exchange, sell and buy goods from other farmers and businesses. However, this feature will not be implemented at this time. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The platform should be user-friendly, secure, and allow for different payment methods. The website should also integrate features that encourage engagement and collaboration among farmers, such as a discussion forum, live chat, and social media links. In addition to the above-mentioned features, the website aims to promote sustainable practices by providing content within the blog feature linked to the latest trends in sustainable farming and research articles relating to conservation within agriculture. The weather feature notifying the users of when the best time to plant, harvest and irrigate crops. This in itself promotes sustainable practices and allows for water conservation by receiving up-to-date precipitation reports to assist in gauging irrigation times, to maximising yields by providing information  to when the most efficient timeframe to harvest.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally we will test the website to ensure that it is functional and user-friendly and launch the website and promote it to the target audience through social media, email marketing, and other digital marketing channels. We can continue to track website metrics, such as traffic and engagement, and use the data to make improvements to the website over time. This can include adding new features, updating content, and optimizing the user experience. 
            </p>
            <h3>How We Began – Kate </h3>
            <p>
                In assignment 1 both Samith and Mihail presented project concepts focused on supporting agricultural processes, and this sparked the interest of our group. The group aligned that their original concepts were not feasible given the groups skillsets, the timeframe of the project and the capital investment required; both of these concepts involved hardware in the form of a microcomputer. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The group did considerable research on what information farmers need access to, to support their day to day tasks and to support their long term goal of producing a high yield crop at the end of the growing season. There are many different tools that exist in the market and many different sources of information that a farmer may use day to day, to access the information they require. Our concept then became clear; an app and website that is a ‘one stop shop’ where farmers can access different information resources in one place. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In assignment two, the group identified the app would have main features: Price commodity data, weather forecasts, blog section, social platform and a library of common machinery user manuals. However, as our concept progressed the group reflected that there were ideas for many differing features, and after a point it served only to increase complexity of the project, and make the end product too haphazard. As a result the social platform was descoped from the project plan and the weather forecast functionality was further developed to be more specialised, delivering the ability to receive crop and location specific advice based on weather patterns. 
            </p>
            <h3>How It Progressed – Sunggil </h3>
            <p>
                During the project, we considered several ideas for features to add to the website. One idea was to include a live stream of farming events, but we decided against this due to time constraints and the need to keep the website focused on its core features. We also explored the possibility of adding a virtual reality component to the website, allowing users to experience farm life in a more immersive way. However, after further discussion, we agreed that this feature would be too complex and expensive to implement given our limited resources. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another idea that we explored was to develop an app that integrates with the website and provides users with real-time updates and notifications. While this could have added value to the website, we ultimately decided to focus on the website itself, as creating an app would have required additional time and resources that we did not have. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We also considered the possibility of creating a feature that allows users to track the progress of their crops and receive personalized advice on how to improve their yield. However, we decided to focus on the weather feature instead, as this was more aligned with the website's core objectives and the team's skillset. 
            </p>
            <p>
                One other idea was to implement a marketplace that would help farmers with market prices of common commodities in the Australian Market as well as creating business and relations with other farmers but decided to descope it as we had limited time and skills on hand. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, we explored the possibility of creating a feature that would allow users to receive alerts when there is a change in market prices for specific crops. However, we ultimately decided to focus on the weather feature, as this was a more critical feature for our users. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After implementing the weather feature, to make the website more suited for farmers, we implemented a page of manuals that would be useful for farmers and also a blog section which is also a main concept of the website that helps farmers with extra farming information.  
            </p>
            <h3>Where we got up to - Peter</h3>
            <p>
                Currently, our project has reached an initial development stage and we have successfully created an MVP as a proof of concept for our idea. We delved deeper into our concept and developed the basic structure of our application using JSX. Additionally, by using Tailwind CSS, we were able to create styles and make our app somewhat responsive to various screen sizes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding our main objective, we have made significant progress by acquiring a free API key from a popular weather API service provider. Subsequently, we made calls to the API and obtained relevant weather data. We then refined the data to serve our potential users according to our application specifications. The most important data we gathered were weather temperature and humidity, and we were able to develop a simple proof of concept alert system based on pre-existing variables. Furthermore, we have given our users the ability to set their own variables in terms of key temperatures and humidity values. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We also created a navigation bar with two additional pages: the manuals page, which contains a series of manuals that users might find useful, and the blog section, which has a series of blog posts. For proof-of-concept purposes, we provided only one type of manual and one blog post, but we replicated them multiple times to give an idea of how the finished product should look like. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, our project is currently live on netlify and accessible for our stakeholders to interact with and provide useful ideas for potential improvements. We welcome any feedback that can help us improve our product and ensure that it meets the needs and expectations of our users. 
            </p>
            <h3>What Still Needs to be Done – Charlie </h3>
            <p>
                The focus which we have aimed for is to create a product which has few programming errors. This is so our web application is in a complete and ready-state upon release it will give a user their first impression that we are a more professional and organised group, prepared to deliver more expansible and useable software with our group’s growth. Therefore, our primary goal has been to create a solid backbone for our web application to grow and flourish on. In doing this, our future features are nearly coming ready to present, such as our library of manuals and reference material. We set off this journey anticipating that we would be able to get our program into a working state with accurate weather reports, which has been successfully completed. Our project still has many more steps to go through so that it can become a fully working program and ready for production. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Within our group we did not meet every single aim, however, we did remain within scope and therefore our progress is suitably on track. Our primary limitation of technical skill and knowledge was a major element in why our group work has been delayed. With more time in order to further develop our team’s skills will further enhance the contributions each member is able to have on work rhythm and therefore increase the velocity of development. Due to our team’s skill shortage we did not meet the aim of displaying long term weather data within our time span, though this concept sat outside of our scope for our short timeframe. Though, we did complete a rudimentary version of this where we forecasted the next week of weather data were able to make weather suggestions based on that data. This deliverable is integral to our full working state product, since without it the product we are delivering is equivalent to a phone’s weather built-in weather application. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Standing within our scope, though not integral to the working state of our web application we would have preferred to add an RSS feed. We have created a template for this aim to work off. The primary objective of this aim was not to the act of implementing it through our product, however, as a method of teaching older yet still foundational technologies to personnel which are still learning the basic grasps of IT and what bounds it has. Many of our members had not experienced RSS feeds prior to this project, and therefore it is believed that the aim of introducing the technology was achieved, however it was never implemented into a working state. Which would have been preferred to create the RSS feed into a state where data can be added from an external location. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, within our scope, however the manuals do not expand a lot of information. In order to create this we would be required to have possible deals with industrial partners and present their information. We would need to grow our project largely in order to do this, and have some form of following and a reason for industrial partners to want to join our cause or application. This is a flaw which we did assess when deciding on this aim, however, we have instead modified it to be a repository of information from external providers, such as efficient farming practices by CSIRO. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Just to name a few aims which had not yet been met, however, they are the aims which stand out as possibly having the largest industrial benefit versus cost. There were other aims, such as the creation of a forum where users may be able to post and communicate with one another, however it does not sit well within the cost versus gain bracket in our starting project. Therefore, the primary objective which we will strive for is to remain within our scope and produce more specific weather data and insights, RSS feeds presenting readily-available information on demand, and a manuals and reference section which presents tips and tricks from external suppliers, therefore building a larger agricultural community.
