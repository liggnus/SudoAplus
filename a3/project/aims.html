            <p>
                Working within an agricultural field is greatly influenced by the weather and other factors of climate.
                Sudo A+ is creating a web-interface application which is designed to help agricultural workers to make informed decisions based on a number of aims.
                These aims have been developed in order to provide these weather and agriculture information in one collated resource.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sudo A+ is creating a web-interface application which sorts weather data in order to present it in a readable and efficient method for farmers to be able to focus less on calculating possible weather outcomes and therefore the potential impacts it may have on their crops. This web application’s primary aim is therefore to be able to forecast the weather in a long term basis with relevance to the specific crop chosen to be grown. The other premise which is aimed to be released within the first iteration of the web-application is for farmers to be able to fetch manuals, tools, and other relevant reference material to conduct works on their property. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The first primary aim of the Sudo A+ web application is to fetch weather data long term and calculate the possible impacts this data may have on the crops. This has a high priority since it, in terms of utility, it is matching of the usability in other applications such as the Strawberry Advisory System (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.agroclimate.sas&gl=US) and therefore it matches a capability of Custom Weather Alerts (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.vazquezsoftware.weatheralarms&gl=US). However, the advantage which this program holds over Custom Weather Alerts is that it is all pre-set up for use, and therefore does not require to be set up by a customer restricted by their computer literacy skills. The potential of this feature is the highest, and the original inspiration for this project. The concept of this part of this aim is that, in future, it will be embedded within a user’s profile and adequately fetch the correct and relevant weather data and fact amongst the other parts of the site. However, this is just potential growth of product and is not a goal set within the beginning iterations of this program. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The secondary aim of the web application is to hold a library of relevant information such as manuals and reference material. Essentially, becoming a library for farmers to easily fetch manuals for relevant jobs which they are requiring to complete within their farm, such as the possibility of a broken tractor requiring fixing without being nearby the mechanical manual. The priority is placed high on this since it creates an element which is aspired to be achieved, a reason to return to the web-application for more reasons than just to fetch the morning weather. This risks a user not needing to return to the website, and possibly forgetting about it. Therefore, if there is a reason for a user to return to the website throughout the day, such as to get their manual for their new tractor while they are a few kilometres away from their house, then it is a better reason than any in order to implement this simple feature. Its aim is to assist a customer with reduced computer literacy find what documents and manuals they may require on the internet. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Other aims contained within this project are based around the user experience and the desire to return to the website. This “reel in” effect is desirable since the final objective of this project is to create a sense of community for isolated societies and people. Making a person come back in order to be satisfied with their contributions can be executed through a community forum. The community forum will be implemented through an API which will handle the ingoing and outgoing data in an orderly fashion, thus ensuring security practices are up to a quality standard which may not be achievable through a small team of approximately six members.

                A feature implemented into our web application is to fetch a newsfeed through the usage of the RSS feed techniques. This will require the implementation of an XML reader into the website, and to format it in order to display the required information in our feed appropriately. The advantage to having an RSS feed will be that the website will be able to send information to the users in an enhanced live-feed updated regularly. This live feed will display relevant information such as weather announcements and important news for farmers to know. It will have the availability to be location based in the future, so that, for example, a user in northern Queensland is not receiving irrelevant information about the southern coastline. The priority of this feature is based around the safety and general awareness of our consumers to be able to make appropriate decisions to caring for their crop with the most accurate and relevant information which we can provide to them in a real time unpredictable time such as weather forecasts changing erratically and possibilities of bug storms which may eat the crops prior to harvest.
