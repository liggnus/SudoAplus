            <h2>Roles</h2>
            <p>
                In our team, there doesnâ€™t seem to be any clear and-cut assigned roles for everyone, as such we all seem to be doing something different based on the needs of the project at the time. Our team dynamic could be described as that of generalists. That helps us all contribute to different parts of the project and bring ideas and allows us to tackle the hard parts as a team and collaborate more effectively by bringing forward new ideas in the discussion, similar to a swarm approach in an agile environment. Keeping in mind that we are generalists we have identified the strengths and weaknesses of our team and there seems to be a pattern forming in regards to which tasks are more easily completed by which person based on their previous knowledge and experience. For example, although we do not have a clear role of a project manager Katherine seems to have experience in managing projects so she usually assists the team in defining clear priorities and aligns everyone to be on the same page while also assisting with developing new ways of tracking our project. Similarly, the role of a lead developer is not present but as per our previous assignment, Charlie seems to be more comfortable leading a tech project, so he tends to provide the most assistance in the area. This is the case with the rest of our group with members usually performing tasks that feel comfortable doing and taking lead on those but also concurrently dipping their toes in different areas and providing continuous support. This approach allows for more diversity in perspectives and gives everyone an opportunity to learn and develop different skills along the way.
