                The farmer weather web application will provide farmers with the ability to access a wide range of weather-related information, including current weather conditions, short term forecasts, historical data, and long-term weather forecasts. This information will assist farmers to make informed decisions about their crops and agricultural practices. The application will also provide alerts for any weather events which may impact crops, such as frost, heatwaves, storms, or bug infestations. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The limitations of this application include, but are not limited to: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Time and resources available, </li>
                    <li>Due to the reliance on external weather data sources, the accuracy of the information cannot be guaranteed, 
                        <ul>
                            <li>This has a possibility to be minimised in the future by employing personnel such as meteorologists and agricultural engineers and practitioners which have specialised knowledge in the field.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Degraded internet connectivity environment due to remote geographic area of target audience.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                Due to the limitations of our project, there are a few aims which are out of scope. The scope of the project will include: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Weather data gathering and presentation to users, </li>
                    <li>Availability to source user manuals. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The long-term scope of this project which will be completed without the limitation of time and resources, is that develop weather advise per crop. Due to the limitation, the application will only provide forecasts for one crop to create a working, presentable model.
