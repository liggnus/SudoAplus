                The software that we will use for this project are Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Yarn, Create React App, React, Axios, Tailwind CSS, Chrome/any internet explorer, and GitHub. These software are all free to use and require no licenses. However with GitHub, we may choose to upgrade to Team licensing to access web-based support but it is not a necessity. All of our group members know how to use Chrome and have enough basic knowledge and previous experience with GitHub via earlier weeks in the Intro to IT course. Charlie has previous experience with Visual Studio where he has coded in JavaScript, html, and CSS using Visual Studio. Peter has previous experience with Yarn, Create React App, React, Axios, and Tailwind CSS where he has used in the past for his previous jobs. The hardware required for this project is a laptop/PC and a mobile device with internet access that also has internet browsing capabilities such through the use of Chrome.
