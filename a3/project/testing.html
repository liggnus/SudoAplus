            <p>Testing is an important part of the development process, to be executed during development and on completion. 

                Each separate deliverable that makes up our final product needs to be tested for functionality, and the integration of each deliverable also requires testing. During development regular updates form the GitHub will ensure our coding is correct. This part is easy to test- if the website looks as it should and, links work etc. the test is successful. 
                
                Testing of different functionality should be conducted throughout the project, as separate deliverables are created, as well as in depth testing end to end on completion of the project as a whole. </p>
            <p>
                A test plan should include test scenarios for each deliverable, to test happy path and unhappy path scenarios. The tests are successful if the expected outcome is reached and documented. The number of test scenarios would be extensive and would include:

                Each of the identified test scenarios should be tested first by the development team, to identify and fix any defects before testing with external parties. Next, a user who is not the end user should retest each scenarios. This retest could be done by a third party or by our customer. Finally, user acceptance testing needs to be carried out by members of the general public. No skill set is required, but  it would be ideal to get a large group of testers to make the job less labour intensive. These users could be sourced through a third party, or we could make an offer to the public such as a reward or incentive for participation. Required end user testing resources is approximately 40 hours, allowing one hour to conduct a test of each scenario, which many scenarios required for each deliverable of the final product.
