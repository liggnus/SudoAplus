                I'm from Victoria, Australia and currently live in New South Wales, Australia. I am 24 years old. I moved to New South Wales because I currently work in IT within the Department of Defence and I am moving state every few years. I have lived in every major city on the East coast, Brisbane, Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne, and Hobart.  
    I always get asked, "What is the best city?" or "Which is your favourite city to live in?" 
    I think the answer to this is simple, every city has its own lifestyle, and the only way to answer that question is to experience it for yourself. I think every place in Australia sits on an even level, and every person within the country is individually fantastic - making every city individually fantastic. 
    I speak English and Swedish, but my Swedish is very poor since I haven't used it for over 8 years. I intend on learning another language, but I am currently stumped by the idea of do I learn what I'm interested in; Italian, or do I learn what would be more useful; Mandarin. 
    Additionally, you may have noticed, I love learning new things and excelling. I try to put 100% into everything I do. The brain was made to be used; why waste the opportunity we have?

                My name is Katherine Sullivan S3670541. I am an Australian that is currently living, working and studying abroad in Dusseldorf, Germany.  

 I am in my final year of a Bachelor of Business in Logistics and Supply Chain Management, and I have taken on the Essentials of Information Technology COSC2196 as an elective subject. Outside of working in the Supply Chain industry I enjoy traveling, cooking, making music and doing all of these things with friends and family. I enjoy group work and hope to broaden my IT and team works skills through collaboration in this subject.

                have been living in Brisbane, Queensland for the last seven years, currently studying Introduction to Information Technology, combined with Introduction to Programming. My aim is to gain a bachelor's degree in Information Technology or Computer Science. Past educational experiences include attending TAFE studying information technology at a certificate level, completed certificate III, started certificate IV. I also studied Automotive Engineering during my teenage/early twenties. Unfortunately, circumstances out of my control prevented any further study at the time. Additionally, I studied Web Communications as an initial entry attempt into university, about three years ago.  

My interests are programming, 3D (3 Dimensional) modelling, gaming, playing guitar and playing golf on odd occasions. I do not usually have an ample amount of time to practice any of these skills to any great extent and my lack of expertise shows it. I am of partial Russian/New Zealander decent, although being born in Australia. I am only fluent in one language being English, though I know and understand a miniscule amount of Russian. I have lived in Queensland for most of my life, once venturing to Sydney for a few months, an experience to remember which had its highs and lows.

                My name is Panagiotis Papanastasatos (Peter), and my student number is 3997743 My team’s chosen name is SudoA+. As far as my educational background I had previously started a degree in computer science at Swinburn university but due to work and recent changes in my schedule I needed to change to RMIT online in order to better accommodate my other commitments. I enjoy web development mainly front-end, and I love building new concepts and seeing new ideas come to life through my work. I have some basic experience in the field, mainly in my spare time I was able to, build a few full-stack web applications with a number of web frameworks and libraries and have also built smaller apps trying to experiment with different programming languages and try out new things. I have also worked in a professional setting with a Melbourne-based start-up as a ‘full-stack web developer intern’ for 3 months and more recently I have also worked at Nintendo ANZ as a ‘junior frontend web developer’ for a period of 6 months. When I am not behind a computer or working I enjoy keeping fiscally active so I usually go to the gym or bouldering with my group of friends.

                My background is South Korean, and I moved to Australia when I was 5. I enjoy playing video games on my pc with my mates and also love making music and listening to music. My interest in IT began as early as I began playing games and also when helping out my friends and peers with problems regarding technology. I do not have any formal IT experience other than my own diy projects completed via YouTube videos whether that was optimizing my PC setup to run hard to run games to hacking simple phone games so I had millions of coins. My team went with the name SudoA+ courtesy of Charlie as it was related to IT and had a meaning where it allows you to temporarily elevate your current user account to have root privileges and in this case our grade to an A+.
