                <p> My name is Charlie Morrison. I am 24 years old and apart of the group "Sudo A+".<br/> I have been working in IT within the Department of Defence for the last 4-5 years.<br/> I am undertaking the Bachelor of Information Technology in order
                    to expand my knowledge of the area, and to progress my career from a level 1/2 helpdesk operator. </p>
                <p> I first got interested in computers when my dad would work from home, back in 2004.<br/> I thought everything that the computer did was magical.<br/> Just like everyone else my age, I wanted to be a magician. I wanted to learn how to use
                    this box of magic. And thus, grows the passion of this, then, 6-year-old boy, playing around with the computer. </p>

            <p> have been living in Brisbane, Queensland for the last seven years, currently studying Introduction to Information Technology, combined with Introduction to Programming. My aim is to gain a bachelor's degree in Information Technology or Computer
                Science. Past educational experiences include attending TAFE studying information technology at a certificate level, completed certificate III, started certificate IV. I also studied Automotive Engineering during my teenage/early twenties.
                Unfortunately, circumstances out of my control prevented any further study at the time. Additionally, I studied Web Communications as an initial entry attempt into university, about three years ago. My interests are programming, 3D (3
                Dimensional) modelling, gaming, playing guitar and playing golf on odd occasions. I do not usually have an ample amount of time to practice any of these skills to any great extent and my lack of expertise shows it. I am of partial Russian/New
                Zealander decent, although being born in Australia. I am only fluent in one language being English, though I know and understand a miniscule amount of Russian. I have lived in Queensland for most of my life, once venturing to Sydney for
                a few months, an experience to remember which had its highs and lows. </p>

As far as my educational background I had previously started a degree in computer science at Swinburn university but due to work and recent changes in my schedule I needed to change to RMIT online in order to better accommodate my other commitments. I enjoy web development mainly front-end, and I love building new concepts and seeing new ideas come to life through my work. I have some basic experience in the field, mainly in my spare time I was able to, build a few full-stack web applications with a number of web frameworks and libraries and have also built smaller apps trying to experiment with different programming languages and try out new things. I have also worked in a professional setting with a Melbourne-based start-up as a ‘full-stack web developer intern’ for 3 months and more recently I have also worked at Nintendo ANZ as a ‘junior frontend web developer’ for a period of 6 months. When I am not behind a computer or working I enjoy keeping fiscally active so I usually go to the gym or bouldering with my group of friends. </p><div> <button id="charlie" class="close" value="quit-charlie">Close</button> </div></form> </dialog> <dialog class="samith"> <form method="dialog"> <p> <label>Samith Buthgama - S3994960</label>                </p>

            <p> My background is South Korean, and I moved to Australia when I was 5. I enjoy playing video games on my pc with my mates and also love making music and listening to music. My interest in IT began as early as I began playing games and also
                when helping out my friends and peers with problems regarding technology. I do not have any formal IT experience other than my own diy projects completed via YouTube videos whether that was optimizing my PC setup to run hard to run games
                to hacking simple phone games so I had millions of coins. My team went with the name SudoA+ courtesy of Charlie as it was related to IT and had a meaning where it allows you to temporarily elevate your current user account to have root
                privileges and in this case our grade to an A+. </p>
