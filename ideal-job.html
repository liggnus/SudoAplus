            <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
            <p>
                Our groupâ€™s five ideal jobs primarily revolve around software development.
                There seems to be quite a bit of diversification in the type of software development.
                With group members want to do Front-End work that focuses more on the design and development of the user interface of a web application.
                They would work with technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the visual and interactive elements of websites and applications that users interact with through their web browsers.
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast to that, we also have team members who are more interested in the process of web development on a more holistic basis thus being interested in Full-Stack development basically a web developer who is proficient in both front-end and back-end development.
                In addition to having the skills of a front-end developer, they also have the skills to work with servers, databases, and the back-end logic of web applications.
                They would work with technology's such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, react.js, vue.js and make use of concepts such as test driven development and REST API's.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, we have other members interested in software development thus looking for careers as software developers responsible for the development of computer programs.
                This can include creating applications for desktop or mobile devices, as well as developing systems and utilities that run on computers.
                Software developers work with a variety of programming languages and technologies to build and maintain software systems.
                Some of the skills and technologies that a software developer would use are strong Debugging skills and knowledge of Object Oriented Design Principles, understanding of basic algorithms and being familiar with agile development methodologies and version control systems such as git.  
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast we also have team members interested in getting a role as a graduate software developer, graduate developers usually work independently or as part of a larger team and they are exposed to all deferent types of development in order to them to discover what they enjoy the most and develop an expertise on that skill.
                There main goal is to  keep up to date with the latest industry trends and technologies, and have the ability to learn and adapt quickly as they are constantly improving their skillset.
                Graduate developers can use a number of tools and languages and concept throughout there graduate program and some of them may include, C#, Net core, AWS Angular and more programming languages and frameworks.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, in contrast to the previous roles that are more tech focused, we have members looking for a career in Supply chain and business management, a supply chain business manager is responsible for overseeing and coordinating all aspects of an organization's supply chain operations.
                This includes managing the flow of goods and materials, from procurement and production to distribution and delivery.
                The supply chain manager will develop and implement strategies to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase customer satisfaction.
                They will also manage relationships with suppliers and vendors, negotiate contracts, and track and analyse key performance indicators.
                Additionally, they may also be responsible for forecasting demand, developing logistics and transportation plans, and managing inventory levels.
                They also monitor and review supply chain processes, identifying and implementing improvements as necessary.
                In order to achieve those objectives some of the skills and tools that a Support chain Business manager might use are ERP software and the Microsoft office line up of tools.
                The main skills would include strong organisations and communications skills that would include negotiation and strategic thinking and being able to translate ideas to actionable tasks that reflect business requirements.
