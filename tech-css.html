            <h2>Clouds, services, servers</h2>
            <i>Written by Charlie</i>
            <h3>What does it do?</h3>
            <p>
                The role of clouds, services, and servers is to provide a function to a customer.
                These functions vary greatly and they can range from externally hosting a web server, to having a system where personnel within a company can contribute to a document together, or even a location to store files like pictures you want to access from your phone to your computer.
                Clouds are the overarching models behind services and servers. They are what is obtained when both are combined; providing a service through a server.
                Services vary in three different levels or types, from Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and finally, Infrastructure as a Service (PaaS).
                Straying away from cloud computing, the terminology used which is referred to as the step before SaaS, is “on premises.”[1]
            </p>
            <h4>Servers</h4>
            <p>
                Servers do exactly what they say, they serve (HP, 2020). Servers deliver a service or functionality to a customer.
                They work as large and powerful computers, which have been purpose built, to process mass amounts of data quickly and send it efficiently through to a user or device on the other side.
                Therefore, once you connect to the internet, you are connected to an array of servers throughout the world.
                If a server is designed to perform just one task, like printing, it is considered a “specialised server.” 
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, servers vary in size.
                They can be the smallest network cluster considered a “PAN” or a “Personal Area Network” all the way through to a “WAN”, a Wide Area Network.
                The largest WAN in the world spans from every corner high and low, and it is called the internet.
                The internet is not in one sole location, however it is a large collection of servers, switches, routers, and other technologies which have been interconnected in order to provide the customer, client, or user with a seamless experience from browsing Google, to researching on Wikipedia. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Within businesses and organisations, servers can be hosted in-house, or they can be rented from another company which specialises in server management. Businesses can host their servers in a closet or a ‘glass house’, which prevents unauthorised access to these servers.
                If the servers are not held on premises, then it is likely they would be hired out from a company such as Amazon which offers data centres worldwide, with technicians available on-site for any emergency maintenance.
                When a business hosts their own server room within a glass house, they are required to provide this availability in order to ensure their customers can utilise their server at all times.
                However, these internally hosted networks, often referred to as “intranet”, can be more secure as they may be a lower priority target to any adversaries. 
            </p>
            <p>
                All servers use technologies and methods which are compatible with one another to create the world-wide-web work flawlessly.
                The current state of the art of these technologies lies within the large scale monitored and secure LANs (Local Area Network), within schools, universities, and workplaces.
                The extent of the current technology is a secure means of communication throughout a business setting.
                The technologies with this rides on is the current security practices and cybersecurity standards, as often the most utilised cloud services used are social media communications and mass storage solutions, which are vulnerable and high priority targets for adversaries. 
            </p>
            

            <h4>Services & Cloud Computing</h4>
            <p>
                Cloud computing is the overarching term of each service, SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS.
                Whether the servers are located locally or are in an offshore datacentre, all services which they are providing make up for the broad term of “cloud computing.”
                Public clouds are externally hosted services, where the external provider is held responsible for all on-premises security, maintenance, and assurance.
                None of the hardware, software, and supporting infrastructure is owned, managed, or held by the lending business.
                Private clouds, however, are held completely by the business and are held completely on-premises, the opposite to a public cloud.
                However, depending on how the private cloud has been set up, it may not be available to employees at home or outside the boundary of the office.
            </p>
            <p>
                Software as a service is often run from an external server, operating on the internet.
                The lending company is responsible for all software upgrades, security patching, and the underlying infrastructure of the software being provided.
                Often these software products are either based on a subscription basis, to ensure income is produced to conduct these maintenance tasks, or they may be generating revenue through other mediums.
                SaaS is primarily advantageous because it is often the cheapest option, making it simple for small businesses and start-ups to afford, though, this does come at an increased security risk as interactions are being made through the unsecure internet.
                Therefore, if a business is large enough, it may fall victim to man-in-the-middle operations or otherwise undetectable vulnerabilities.
                Additional to this, software as a service is often a non-customisable application made for general use, and serves to please a large audience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Platform as a Service, often referred to as “middleware”, are scalable options for any sized business with the availability to hire a dedicated IT department.
                The platform being marketed is the underlying infrastructure of servers and platform which the servers to run.
                This is inclusive of operating systems.
                The client then no longer has responsibility for software maintenance, resource management, patching, server maintenance, or any further level of managing the servers.
                The lender can also offer different products such as container engines, artificial intelligence, through to big data analytics.
                This is the middle ground between Software as a Service and Infrastructure as a Service, which IaaS is the simplest form.
                IaaS is the basic building blocks of networking, it offers the highest amount of flexibility, just below hosting an independent server farm, which the client hires a network on virtual or dedicated hardware.
                The hardware is scalable, as the lender can associate higher resources to different clients asking for differing services.
            </p>
            <h3>What is the likely impact & how will this affect you?</h3>
            <p>
                Cloud computing is reaching full maturity in the world, as Amazon Web Services (AWS) is beginning to dominate the field.
                A disadvantage to these technologies is that when a disaster occurs at a site, all hosted services utilising that site are then affected.
                However, Amazon’s world-wide scale of their cloud computing technologies builds an advanced level of redundancy which smaller businesses cannot compete with.
                This exemplifies the monopoly which can be easily achieved by a large company in a growing IT field, when executed correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The largest threat which the world of cloud computing faces is the maverick individuals, state-based cybercrime, and issue-based threat actors.
                The news-worthy cyber criminals.
                The more that cyber security enhances, the more data industries are willing to store, making the target more attractive to these cyber criminals.
                The world has recently faced a shift since 2020, a record year in cybercrime, which is forcing a shift in the development of these cloud and online services.
                Cyber security is becoming a highly sought after profession, and unfortunately may risk over saturation with inexperienced workers.
                Since cyber security is sought after so incredibly, cyber engineers which are well known to hirers are getting plucked from underneath.
                This hunt and seek culture which is building up, may end up leading to a worry of under training, since personnel are moving around more often than the time it takes to train an employee.
                Or, since there is a major lack of workers in the cyber field, it may end up you get placed into a position which is of a higher expertise, and you end up becoming responsible for more than what you are comfortable with. 
            </p>
            <p>
                However, this will be occurring in the coming years, and self-training and additional learning is an option that we can all volunteer ourselves for in our spare time leading up to our professional life.  
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of a more positive outlook of the future of the internet, cloud computing and other networks, this will become a larger standard amongst the average industry and IT may begin to continue to work in specialised groups and organisations rather than working directly for a company, may it be through a contract or through a business investment between two companies.
                This will affect IT technicians as they may work at a multi-site business, having to travel between buildings with varied standard operating procedures and other technical documentation pertaining to their standards.
                IT will need to account for a larger amount of technologies being used, as within the business I currently work in, it is standard to track every single computer, printer, and general asset pertaining to IT, and this may end up that IT professionals will be required to track more devices, opening up more time-intensive tedious activities which extend the already increasing workload on the IT workforce.
                However, this will open opportunities for additional levels of automation to take over other manual, data entry, jobs.
                As IT is a general field and contains a vastly in-depth level of many differing technologies, it increases the availability for all IT professionals to learn about differing subjects from their expertise.
                I.e., it may be expected from an employer that you are capable of cloud computing, DSPF management, and trained within ISM – which are three varying fields, yet they all require to be connected within the well-structured field of information technology, since they all pertain to networks.
