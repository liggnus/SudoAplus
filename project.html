            <h2>Project Idea</h2>
            <sub>By SudoA+</sub>
            <h3 id="Overview">Overview</h3>
            <p>
                The project SudoA+ has chosen to do is building a website for farmers.
                Our goal was to choose a project that could be used in a real-world application and to solve the issue that farmers face when looking to cultivate their farming business.
                Our first and main point for our website was to figure out what information farmers mainly look for when preparing for a new season of farming.
                Upon research, our group has all agreed upon that forecast would be the main information farmers sought out for before planting anything.
                A forecast website for farmers would prove to be a valuable tool that helps farmers make informed decisions about planting, harvesting, and other important agricultural activities.
                The website will provide a variety of weather and climate data, including current conditions, short-term and long-term forecasts, and historical records. One of the key features of the website will be its ability to provide localized weather information.
                This is important because weather patterns can vary greatly even within a small geographical area.
                This will allow farmers to input their location and view weather information specific to their area, including precipitation, temperature, wind speed and direction, and other relevant data.
                Another important feature of the will be its ability to provide long-term forecasts.
                This is particularly useful for farmers who are planning to plant crops or make other investments in their land.
                By looking at long-term forecasts, farmers can make more informed decisions about what types of crops to plant and when to plant them.
                The site will also provide historical data that helps farmers understand how weather patterns have changed over time in their area, allowing them to make even more accurate predictions about the future.
                The website will also provide alerts and notifications for severe weather events, such as storms or heatwaves.
                This allows farmers to take action to protect their crops and livestock, and minimize damage to their land.
            </p>
            <h3 id="Motivation">Motivation</h3>
            <p>
                Timing in farming is a crucial factor to achieving the best possible yield when harvest time comes around (Kerr, 2016).
                Planning for the right time to carry out any growing activities is highly dependent on weather patterns and every farmer spends time researching weather patterns as a part of the planning process.
                So, we see a market for delivering a variety of weather information in one place for farmers.<br/>

                Farming can be a very solitary way of life, which often involves living in remote locations and working alone for long hours.
                We see the opportunity to connect farmers, their knowledge and expertise via our website in the way of blogs and a social platform.<br/>

                Our research found that there are many technological solutions on the market that provide one or two of the features our website will incorporate.
                We see our solution as innovative because it can be used by our end user as a hub; a one stop shop to find different types of weather forecasts specific to an area, a forum for sharing advice and learning from other farmers, a place to refer to when you have questions on everyday farm repairs and a forum for social interaction and support.
                To combine these aspects into one platform that is easy to use and navigate we see as an appealing source for our target audience.<br/>

                The challenge of drawing each of these elements together is a great learning experience for our team and will provide us each with the opportunity to develop our growing skills in coding and design.
                This is a strong motivation for the groups decision to pursue this project idea.
            </p>
            <h3 id="Description">Description</h3>
            <div>
                <h4>
                    Price data
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Upon further search, we established that another useful feature that we would want to include in our app is the addition of live price data for the commodities that farmers would be interested in. 
                    
                    This would give them the ability to have one centralized platform hub for all their business-related needs as they would be able to receive live price data for commodities such as oil, grain wheat, etc.
                    This feature is useful for farmers as they require to sell their produce at a specific price for them to be able to make a profit on their crops.
                    In addition, this feature can also include alerts for when the prices of specific commodities reach a certain threshold set by the user.
                    This way, farmers can be notified when the market conditions are favorable for them to sell their produce.
                    This feature can also include historical price data for specific commodities that the user selected.
                    This will help farmers to have a better understanding of the market conditions for the current commodity that they are producing, which will enable them to make more informed decisions on when to sell their produce.
                    It will also increase the usability of our app by providing more value for our users and it will enable us to retain our current user base.<br/>
                    
                    
                    
                    Furthermore, this feature will also help farmers to stay up to date with the market conditions and make better decisions about what to grow and when to sell.
                    This will ultimately help farmers to increase their profits and become more successful as a business.
                </p>
                <h4>Weather Forecasting</h4>
                <p>
                    Weather forecasting is a critical feature that our team has decided to include on our website, as it plays a crucial role in determining the success of agricultural pursuits.
                    Seasons and weather are vital factors in agriculture and farming, and the website's forecasting feature provides farmers with the necessary updates on temperature, wind speed, and precipitation levels.
                    This allows farmers to make informed decisions regarding growing various fruits and vegetables.<br/>
                    
                    The wind speed and temperature forecasting feature are handy for farmers as it helps them to determine the optimal time to apply fertiliser, including the appropriate rate and type.
                    This helps ensure that fertiliser application's lousy timing does not hinder the crop's growth.
                    The feature also allows farmers to determine when to apply pesticides and insecticides to avoid crop loss.
                    Additionally, the wind speed feature helps farmers determine the best time to use pesticides and insecticides so that the sprayed chemicals do not miss their target areas.<br/>
                    
                    Precipitation is also crucial for agriculture, providing the water needed for plants to grow and thrive.
                    Without adequate rainfall, crops will suffer from drought and may not be able to produce a harvest.
                    Additionally, consistent, and well-timed precipitation can help to prevent soil erosion and maintain soil fertility.
                    Our website's precipitation feature is designed to help farmers save water and money by not irrigating when rain is forecasted.<br/>
                    
                    Providing access to accurate and reliable weather forecasts can help farmers make informed decisions that can lead to a more successful and profitable agricultural operation.
                    Weather forecasting can also assist farmers in making crucial business decisions.
                    It helps them plan for the many daily decisions that need to be made, such as crop irrigation, when to fertilise, and when to work in the field.
                    These decisions can significantly impact a crop's profitability and a farmer's competitiveness in the market.
                    With accurate and up-to-date weather forecasts, farmers can make informed decisions leading to higher yields and better crop management.<br/>
                    
                    
                    <ul>
                    </ul>
                    
                </p>
                <h4>Blog Section</h4>
                <p>
                    The website will contain a blog, which will display relevant information such as news pertaining to insect and other pest migrations, sustainable farming techniques, and other relevant information to farmers. 
                    
                    The purpose of this feature is to enhance the useability of the website, and the interest in regular checkups to the website.
                    If the website only contained relevant weather information, then it would only ever need to be checked once per day.
                    However, with a live news feed, we will be able to attract farmers to check up on the website at the end of the day, by displaying interesting information such as discounts of important equipment.
                    This regular news outlet will culminate all important data for farmers, and prevent the need for browsing a large amount of website in order to find information, and decrease the likeliness of local Australian farmers missing out on opportunities which are for short term only. 
                    
                    This feature will fetch data from an RSS feed, or multiple RSS feeds, which have data and news relating to the Australian farmers.
                    It will also include a local RSS feed which will be able to be updated from a location external to the website itself, ensuring a level of security; making uploading to the RSS feed inaccessible from the internet. 
                    
                    The matter of fetching data from multiple RSS feeds will be able to generate a passive revenue to our website and reduce the requirement of cumbersome advertising (which may decrease the useability since Australian farmers often run on slower or intermittent network connectivity).
                    Through using multiple RSS feeds as well, it will be able to increase the available information to the farmers accessing our website, by not requiring our staff to manually update and find news articles themselves.
                </p>
                <h4>Mobile View</h4>
                <p>
                    An important feature of the website is ensuring it is mobile friendly by creating a visually appealing mobile view to improve the user experience.
                    Responsiveness in the web design is important for our end product, this will ensure that when the website is accessed on any device that the interface is user friendly.
                    
                    Taking a responsive approach to the web page development will mean that different style aspects will serve different screen sizes, allow orientation switch and will consider displays to various resolutions (Berry, 2021).
                    Focusing on responsiveness during our web design will eliminate the need to design several different web pages for each different device that the end user may need access from. 
                    
                    Because a key concept our of project is to offer differing resources in one place; this is not just a weather website, it makes the responsiveness of our page design important.
                    The user should be able navigate easily from section to section.
                    They should be able to contribute on forums easily whether accessing via a mobile phone, tablet or desktop and they should be able to search and enter filter criteria with a smooth user experience (Human Service Solutions, 2022). 
                    
                    When we consider a lifestyle of a farmer; working long and unusual hours, operating machinery for many hours at a time, performing physical and repetitive tasks.
                    These factors lead us to believe that our end user may rarely be accessing our website from their PC or laptop in the comfort of their home.
                    This makes a responsive web design a requirement to provide a satisfying user experience from any possible device.
                </p>
                <h4>Machinery Manuals for Farmers</h4>
                <p>
                    A feature we would like to add to our website is a subsection dedicated to providing links to workshop manuals for various farming machinery.
                    We believe this will aid farmers in finding the right information and with this, the possibility of minimizing spending on costly repairs.
                    The initial links will point to paid workshop manuals, and then in the future, will provide information in finding either free manuals or advice to how to find the right information.
                    If free manuals are available, links will be provided to download the file.
                    All attached will files will be pre-scanned for viruses before uploading to ensure the safety of our consumers.
                    
                    
                    
                    Initially, links to the most common machinery will be provided with future updates to expand the database to lesser-known machinery.
                    These links will either be posted on the main page or with the blog section of the website and will be integrated into navigation bars via html for the website This will ensure ease of accessibility.
                    There is also the possibility of monetization by adding affiliate links provided by the publishers of the workshop manuals.
                    
                    
                    
                    The goal of providing these links to relieve some the stress in finding manuals, as it can be a tedious task that can provide little to no results.
                    Having a place where information can be accessed at the click of button, relieve the stress, minimize the time for looking for the right information about a particular piece of machinery, putting more time back into more important tasks.
                    There are also benefits for the site.
                    The benefits in adding these types of links are, attraction of repeat visits from previous visitors, plus the attraction of new visitors to the site.
                </p>
                <h4>Social Platform</h4>
                <p>
                    Another important feature on our farming website would be a social platform.
                    This will allow farmers and gardening enthusiasts to share information, ask questions, and connect with one another.
                    
                    
                    
                    One of the main benefits of a forum is that it allows users to share their experiences and knowledge with others.
                    For example, a farmer who has successfully grown a particular crop in their area can share tips and advice with others who may be struggling with the same crop.
                    Similarly, a gardener who has found a solution to a common pest problem can share their solution with others who may be experiencing the same issue.
                    This type of information sharing is invaluable, as it can help farmers and gardeners to improve their yields and reduce their costs.
                    
                    
                    
                    Another benefit of a forum is that it can be a great place to ask questions and get answers.
                    For example, a new farmer may have questions about how to set up their farm or how to care for their animals.
                    They can post their questions on the forum and receive answers from more experienced farmers.
                    This type of community support is essential for new farmers, as it can help them to get started on the right foot and avoid common mistakes.
                    
                    
                    
                    A forum can also be a great place for farmers and gardeners to connect with one another.
                    For example, farmers who live in the same area can connect and share resources, such as equipment or labor.
                    Similarly, gardeners who have a shared interest in a particular type of plant or gardening technique can connect and share information.
                    This type of networking can be beneficial for farmers and gardeners, as it can help them to build relationships, increase their knowledge, and improve their yields.
                    
                    
                    
                    We will be taking inspiration from successful social media platforms such as Facebook as it proves to be an already working layout that we may be able to replicate but in a more farmers friendly twist to it.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3 id="ToolsTech">Tools & Tech</h3>
            <p>
                For us to be able to successfully build our project we would require to identify the exact tools and technologies that we would need to achieve each of the tasks required.
                We would need to split those technologies into three separate categories based on the tasks that each of them is going to achieve.
                Firstly we would need to look into The front end or the visual aspect of our website. For this part, we could make use of Figma and or Zeplin for prototyping.
                Then the javascript library react.js or gatsby.js for us to be able to make use of the ease of prototyping and the flexibility that it provides with all the addition of UI libraries.
                In conjunction with react.js for the front end, we would also make use of Material UI components or templates to speed up development and prototyping coupled with tailwind CSS, In addition to that we would also make use of vanilla HTML, CSS, JS and get introduced to JSX that incorporates HTML elements into JS.
                For us to be able to serve images as the right resolution regardless of screen size and to make sure we organize all our static images in one place we would make use of the Cloudinary CDN.
                Secondly for our web app to be able to serve dynamic content we would need to make use of external APIs such as the 'dark sky' API to collect and display the weather data, and 'yahoo-finance' to collect and display the commodity price data.
                The way we would make those API calls is by using the Axios library instead of the built-in fetch method as it will speed us the development process. In addition to that, we might require to make use of graphQL depending on what type of calls the API allows for and what we require.
                Finally, to host our app we could make use of either GitHub pages or netlify that would depend on the future whether the project would require more backend functionality such as a connection to a CMS such as contentful for ease of authoring new articles and making editorial changes.
                For us to be able to keep our project on track and manage our team's progress we could use Microsoft teams, Jira, and Mirro to create a visual representation of our project tracking in combination with git/GitHub for paired programming and VSCode or atom as a code editor.
                Although the technologies listed above all work for our project as of now during the development life cycle we might come across the need to swap out or substitute new technologies based on the current needs of the project.   
            </p>
            <h3 id="Skills">Skills</h3>
            <p>
                The skillset required in order to create a website for farmers can be broken up into three different sections:
                The back end, where we will mostly be dealing with the technical challenges and skills required to complete the task.
                The middle end, which will contain all the management, teamwork and associated interpersonal skills in order to create a product.
                And finally, the front end, which is what our target audience will see, which is the attention to detail, our farming knowledge and our ability to advertise this product correctly and accurately to our target audience.
                If any element of this project fails, there will be no product in the end.
                The back end is required in order to create the structure behind our project, the middle end is required for the task to be built correctly and accurately, and the front end – what is a product without a customer?<br/>
                
                JavaScript, HTML5, API implementation, and design skills will be required to create our website.
                HTML5 is the basis of the internet, it is what tells our computer what to show to us on a website.
                JavaScript will communicate with a partnering industry’s website in order to collect relevant data and display it live.
                APIs will be implemented through the use of JavaScript, however this skill also contains the ability to scope out the best product for our service.
                Designing the website may end up complex as we will be required to make the website feel natural to a farmer and not be cumbersome, and effectively, we are seeking to increase the efficiency of the farming industry.<br/>

                Analytical thinking, communication skills, problem-solving, and our teamwork skills will ensure a strong product delivery.
                We will be required to think analytically and problem solve in case we encounter any unforeseen issues throughout this project, and will must be able to communicate these effectively within our team.<br/>

                Our attention to detail and general crop knowledge is what is going to be seen on the surface by our customers.
                If we are fetching data in the incorrect format (Fahrenheit instead of Celsius), we may end up ruining our project and therefore, ruining the efficient use of our project.
                Our general crop knowledge will be what the farmers will be judging most harshly, therefore, in later stages we will be required to take onboard feedback, which may change our project completely, maybe even three times over.
                Yet, we will be required to be resilient in order to successfully complete our project and send it out to the general public.<br/>
            </p>
            <h3 id="Outcome">Outcome</h3>
            <p>
                The outcome of this project is a comprehensive and user-friendly website that serves as a valuable tool for farmers to make informed decisions about planting, harvesting, and other critical agricultural activities.
                The website provides weather and climate data, including current conditions, short-term and long-term forecasts, historical records, price data for commodities, and weather-related tips and best practices.
                It also includes a social platform like a forum, critical weather conditions, and pest and insect warnings and is optimized for mobile view.<br/>
                The outcomes for farmers using our website could be: 
                <ol>
                    <li>Increased crop yields and profits: By making informed decisions about planting, harvesting, and other agricultural activities, farmers can improve their crop yields and increase their profits.</li>
                    <li>Reduced crop loss: By receiving alerts and notifications for severe weather events, farmers can take action to protect their crops and livestock and minimize damage to their land.</li>
                    <li>Increased efficiency: By accessing localized weather information, farmers can optimize their irrigation and fertilization plans and determine the best time to apply pesticides and insecticides, reducing the chance of crop loss due to bad timing.</li>
                    <li>Improved farming practices: By learning from other farmers through social platforms and reading weather-related tips and best practices, farmers can improve their farming practices.</li>
                    <li>Increased accessibility: By having the website optimized for mobile view, farmers can access the information they need from any device, regardless of their location.</li>
                    <li>A Better understanding of the weather patterns in their area: By using historical data, farmers can better understand how weather patterns have changed over time, making even more accurate predictions.</li>
                    <li>Increased knowledge of the commodities prices: price data for commodities can help farmers to plan their sales and purchases.</li>
                    <li>Increased farm safety: critical weather conditions and pest and insect warnings can help farmers prepare for potential hazards and protect their farms.</li>
                </ol>
                Overall, the outcome of this project is a website that provides farmers with a wealth of information and resources to improve the efficiency and success of their farming operations.
