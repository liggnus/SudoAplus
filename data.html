                Each member of the group has chosen a career path that looks promising in terms of demand from employers in Australia.
                When we examine demand for skills, as outlined by the Australian Government, the roles of Front End Developer, Graduate Software Developer, Software Developer, Software Engineer and Full-Stack Develop would all fall under the category title of either Software Engineer or Developer Programmer.
                In 2021, both of these categories were identified as currently experiencing a skills shortage, and having a strong future demand (National Skills Commission, 2021).
                The outlier role; the position of Supply Chain Business Manager, most closely links to the role of Manager Supply Chain and Distribution, which is identified as currently not in skills shortage, but also with a strong future demand (National Skills Commission, 2021), suggesting that while future prospects look good in this field, currently the job market may be competitive in this skill set.

                There are many differing skills that employers may require from job applicants.
                Based on data collected and analysed form Burning Glass Data and Seek.com, the most common skills that are not found in our group skill set are as follows:
            </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>IT Skills</th>
                    <th>General Skills</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>SQL</td>
                    <td>Building Relationships</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>TypeScript Programming</td>
                    <td>Teamwork Skills</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Microsoft Windows</td>
                    <td>Attention to Detail</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
                Interestingly, there were just five IT Skills from the top 20 required IT skills, that were not included in at least one of the groups ideal roles (Burning Glass Technologies, 2018).
                In terms of General skills, an interesting observation is that only one of the groups ideal roles included the requirement for good communication skills- when this is the most common required skill in IT roles (Burning Glass Technologies, 2018).
            </p>
            <p>
                The data analysed from Burning Glass Technology has not changed the perspective of the group as a whole on their ideal job and its required skills.
                It has given insight into the wide range of skills that are applicable across the IT industry, and brought light to how diverse the technical requirements can be, particularly in comparison to the Supplier Chain Manager role that had very limited technical requirements.
                It highlights the need for an IT professional to have a broad range of skills and to be committed to continuous learning in order to remain competitive in the job market.
                The data from burning glass that depicted the number of positions advertised in our ideal roles is encouraging to the prospect of future job security.
                Another piece of data that is affirming in this space is that for each of the chosen ideal IT jobs, Seek.com, 2022, have projected a 27% job growth in the next five years.
