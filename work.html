                    My interactions can be varied and depend heavily on the nature of the work and/or project that I’m currently resourced to or undertaking.
                    Interactions with management may pertain to commercials, project resourcing and reporting of assorted metrics.
                    At the architecture level there may be engagement to assist in the drafting SOW’s, coming up with solutions to problems or development work.
                    I also engage in offering L3 support and sustainment to fellow consultants, engineers and technicians/analysts.
